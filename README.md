# Problem Statement: Sentiment Analysis with Enhanced Context Understanding
The growing volume of online text data, such as social media posts, reviews, and customer feedback, necessitates efficient and accurate sentiment analysis techniques. This project aims to develop a robust sentiment analysis model that leverages the strengths of Transformers and LSTMs to achieve superior performance in understanding and classifying sentiment within text data.
# Proposed Solution:
This project proposes a hybrid model combining Transformers and LSTMs for sentiment analysis.
Transformers excel at capturing long-range dependencies within sequences, allowing the model to understand the sentiment even when sentiment-indicating words are not close together.
LSTMs are adept at handling sequential data and capturing contextual information within sentences.
By combining these techniques, the model aims to achieve a deeper understanding of context and sentiment within text data.
